So I have been traveling some in the past couple of weeks.

I like to visit friends and familiy who live in different cities.
That way I get so much out of my vacations: I get to connect with
nice people that I don't see often enough, I get to sleep somewhere
for free, and I get a unique view of the place that I visit.
This unique view also helps me visualize my friends' stories
better in the future.

At some point I noticed, that I had scheduled some of those visits
very close together without noticing. Since I was very ready for a
vacation anyways, I took off about 3 weeks from work to travel around.
I got to visit Utrecht, Berlin, Cologne, Leipzig, Erlangen, and Hanover.
It was pretty exhausting, both because of the long travel times and
the frequend packing of suitcases, and becauseI was constantly around
people, which I am not really used to as a remotely working Software
Engineer. But it was also very rewarding asI got to see a lot of stuff
and a lot of people.

I think my major takeaway from this adventure is how important
different and new impressions and experiences are for me. Just
stimulating my brain and my senses differently made me feel great
and very open. I saw the world around me in different ways and
felt very motivated. All of this sounds a bit cheesy, but I know what
I mean, and this blog is primarily for me anyway.

So in conclusion, get out and do stuff.
