My latest project was to build a custom counter for my kitchen.

I was lacking
surface space in my kitchen, so I wanted to add a counter. Since I had some
space with very specific dimensions, I decided to build one myself to make
the most of the space. I went with some oak wood sealed with ecological linseed
oil.

I started with the top, since it had the most precise requirements in terms
of size to fit in the space. I then took most of the other measurements by
fitting the parts directly into the assembly. This turned out to be one of
my biggest takeaways: Not all parts have to be perfect by themselves, they
just need to fit together. And the best way to make them fit together ist
to adapt methods and measurements as you go. Kind of like a woodworking
analogy to lean and agile software development.

Another takeaway of this project came from the fact that the finished counter fit
perfectly into the given space, but the process was long and tedious. I also
ordered a TV stand from IKEA, which was assembled in half a day and works
just fine along my empty wall. So if
you need something very specific, it is worth putting in the time and effort.
But if the requirements are more generic or not as crucial, it is easier, faster
and likely cheaper to just go with something generic and pre-made.
