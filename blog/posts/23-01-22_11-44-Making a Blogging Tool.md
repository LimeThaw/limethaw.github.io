Making a Blogging Tool
--

I decided to record my projects a little bit better. I hope that this helps
me reflect a little bit more on what I am doing and why, and learn a bit more
from my adventures. For this purpose I decided to start this little blog.

First things first, I needed to settle on a platform. Since I only intend
to share static content here, and I am already using GitHub a lot, I decided
to use GitHubs pages infrastructure to host the blog. I didn't immediately find
a blogging software that I really liked, since most seemed to be a little much
setup for what I need. And since I am a programmer and looking for projects to
learn new things, I decided to make my own. I settled on simple markdown as
format to write the articles, JSON to store metainfo in a concise manner that
is readable to both machines and humans, and python to write a little command
line tool to help me manage everything.

As of writing this, I am implementing the Python tool. It seems interesting
to create such a minimalistic piece of software, since I don't really have
to think too much about use- and edge cases, but just conde in what I need
right now.
