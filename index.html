<p>So I have been traveling some in the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I like to visit friends and familiy who live in different cities.
That way I get so much out of my vacations: I get to connect with
nice people that I don't see often enough, I get to sleep somewhere
for free, and I get a unique view of the place that I visit.
This unique view also helps me visualize my friends' stories
better in the future.</p>
<p>At some point I noticed, that I had scheduled some of those visits
very close together without noticing. Since I was very ready for a
vacation anyways, I took off about 3 weeks from work to travel around.
I got to visit Utrecht, Berlin, Cologne, Leipzig, Erlangen, and Hanover.
It was pretty exhausting, both because of the long travel times and
the frequend packing of suitcases, and becauseI was constantly around
people, which I am not really used to as a remotely working Software
Engineer. But it was also very rewarding asI got to see a lot of stuff
and a lot of people.</p>
<p>I think my major takeaway from this adventure is how important
different and new impressions and experiences are for me. Just
stimulating my brain and my senses differently made me feel great
and very open. I saw the world around me in different ways and
felt very motivated. All of this sounds a bit cheesy, but I know what
I mean, and this blog is primarily for me anyway.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, get out and do stuff.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title article-title">Building A Counter</h5>
						<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted article-date">06.03.2023</h6>
						<div class="card-text article-text">
<p>My latest project was to build a custom counter for my kitchen.</p>
<p>I was lacking
surface space in my kitchen, so I wanted to add a counter. Since I had some
space with very specific dimensions, I decided to build one myself to make
the most of the space. I went with some oak wood sealed with ecological linseed
oil.</p>
<p>I started with the top, since it had the most precise requirements in terms
of size to fit in the space. I then took most of the other measurements by
fitting the parts directly into the assembly. This turned out to be one of
my biggest takeaways: Not all parts have to be perfect by themselves, they
just need to fit together. And the best way to make them fit together ist
to adapt methods and measurements as you go. Kind of like a woodworking
analogy to lean and agile software development.</p>
<p>Another takeaway of this project came from the fact that the finished counter fit
perfectly into the given space, but the process was long and tedious. I also
ordered a TV stand from IKEA, which was assembled in half a day and works
just fine along my empty wall. So if
you need something very specific, it is worth putting in the time and effort.
But if the requirements are more generic or not as crucial, it is easier, faster
and likely cheaper to just go with something generic and pre-made.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title article-title">Making a Blogging Tool</h5>
						<h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted article-date">22.01.2023</h6>
						<div class="card-text article-text">
<p>I decided to record my projects a little bit better. I hope that this helps
me reflect a little bit more on what I am doing and why, and learn a bit more
from my adventures. For this purpose I decided to start this little blog.</p>
<p>First things first, I needed to settle on a platform. Since I only intend
to share static content here, and I am already using GitHub a lot, I decided
to use GitHubs pages infrastructure to host the blog. I didn't immediately find
a blogging software that I really liked, since most seemed to be a little much
setup for what I need. And since I am a programmer and looking for projects to
learn new things, I decided to make my own. I settled on simple markdown as
format to write the articles, JSON to store metainfo in a concise manner that
is readable to both machines and humans, and python to write a little command
line tool to help me manage everything.</p>
<p>As of writing this, I am implementing the Python tool. It seems interesting
to create such a minimalistic piece of software, since I don't really have
to think too much about use- and edge cases, but just conde in what I need
right now.</p>
<p>Next up is the design. I usesome boilerplate code that I made a few years
back when I experimented with web design during the pandemic. Back then, I
used LESS stylesheets, but I have since realized that the longer load times
caused by the Just-In-Time compilation makes for a pretty bad user experience,
so I switched to SCSS instead, which I can compile within VS Code. I also use
Bootstrap, which is handy, but I don't have a lot of experience with it, so
I scavenged some online examples and tutorials for inspiration. Keeping in
line with the tone of this project, the design is very minimalistic and only
contains what is absolutely necessary for the current state.</p>
<p>For the final part, the generation of the actual website. I split my design
into one template for the page, and one for an article. I then used Python's
Template substitution to insert my data in a two-step process, one substitution
for every article, and then the insertion into the page. Thanks to Python's
extensive library ecosystem I could simply use a library to translate the
Markdown into HTML.</p>
<p>So for now, this blog page seems to be complete. It is very simplistic,
but does exactly what I want for now. Next steps could include a better
design, dev-ops and monitoring of some kind, or an article view to read
single articles. These could be generated into their own HTML files,
which would probably even scale, since the required space is still roughly
linear to the number of articles. If I want to reduce redundancy, I could
also load the article part using JavaScript, so I only have to store the
page part of the template once.</p>
<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. For now I'm done.</p>
